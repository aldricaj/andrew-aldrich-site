Hello, my name is Andrew. I am currently a software developer in the University of Cincinnati's Office of Research. While working at UC, I've become a jack of all trades.
I've done desktop support, SharePoint site administration, project management, and CI/CD on top of normal software development. In the Office of Research, I have introduced software development practices
such as source control, code reviews, test strategies, and agile philosophies. To me my greatest accomplishment has been mentoring extremly junior developers and seeing them grow into
fully-functional members of the team.

While I have not had the luxury of being explore the depths of a specific technology, I have been blessed with the opportunity to learn a broad range of skills allowing me comfortably
work in most aspects of an IT department.
